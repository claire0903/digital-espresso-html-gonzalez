Architectural Strategy: 

Given the tecnical constraints, the website shall make use of a flat folder structure composed of (about.html, branches.html, index.html, products.html) which ensures that all pages are easily linked together. This can be seen in the gloval navigation element. For the images to be used, a separate folder shall be used to ensure that everything is organized.
